# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis - Washington State

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the EV population growth in the state of Washington from 1997 to 2023. In 1997, only one electric vehicle was registered in the state, and over time, that number had exponentially increased to reach 181,000 EVs as of 2024. one of the main reasons behind this growth is federal policies, pushing for clean energy vehicles with the Biden Executive Order in 2022. if you're interested to know more about this policy, access the Harvard University Article [here](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/what-the-us-is-getting-right-and-wrong-about-the-move-to-electric-vehicles/), or read the BBC Journal [Here](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57253947)
